Part of the series focuses on the Reich-Race War of the mid-1960s, when the Greater German Reich and the Race fight a nuclear war. The commander hesitates, and considers turning back without revealing The Race's presence to the humans but finally decides to avoid the disgrace of that course of action. The second series of novels, set in the 1960s, deals with the interaction between surviving humans and the Race. The following is a list of some of the major characters from the series. Although the Race has the advantage of superior technology, its information on humanity had been collected by a robotic probe during the 12th century AD. The invasion ultimately ends with all of the major Allied and Axis powers managing to develop their own nuclear weapons, which results in a stalemate. Turtledove approaches the novels' science fiction scenario by focusing less on the technological and fantasy elements that are typically associated with the genre.
